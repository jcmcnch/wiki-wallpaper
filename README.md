230203: Forked so I can add my modification of the original script here for backup. I use this to download the Wikipedia POTD to a folder so I can use Vallpaper on KDE Neon which only supports links or folders, unlike the normal background on KDE Neon. Vallpaper allows one to use different desktop backgrounds but is more limited in terms of its ability to pull from POTD repos.

# A simple python script which download picture of the day from http://commons.wikimedia.org and make it as wallpaper of your Linux Desktop.
